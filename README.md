# Project Proposal: Sermon Transcription and Editing Platform

## Introduction:
Thank you for considering my proposal to develop a Sermon Transcription, Translation, and Editing Platform. I am eager to present a thorough solution that not only simplifies the process of transcribing and editing sermons but also includes the ability to translate them into another language. Drawing upon my experience with React.js for the front end and .NET for the back end, alongside the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, I aim to deliver a cost-effective, adaptable, and efficient platform that fulfills your extended requirements.

## Project Scope:
1. Upload Functionality:
   - Develop a user-friendly interface for uploading audio or video files, including support for YouTube links.
   - Ensure smooth handling of different file formats and efficient processing of user inputs.

2. Automatic Snipping:
   - Implement an automatic clipping feature to extract sermon clips from full-service videos.
   - Provide a thorough analysis of the feasibility and complexity of this feature, ensuring transparency in project planning.

3. Transcription using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API:
   - Integrate the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for accurate transcription of sermon content.
   - Explore cost-effective transcription options to minimize expenses while maintaining transcription quality.

4. Integration with Language Models for Speaker Identification:
   - Research and integrate Language Models (LLMs) to enhance transcription quality and speaker identification.
   - Select an appropriate LLM solution based on budget constraints and project requirements.

5. Integration with Pre-existing Translation Services/APIs for Long Text Translation:
   - Investigate and integrate pre-existing translation services/APIs to facilitate sermon translation into another language.
   - Choose a suitable translation solution considering budget constraints and project needs.

6. Editing and Displaying Transcripts:
   - Develop an intuitive editing interface to display transcribed content in an editable text format.
   - Enable users to rectify transcription errors and make necessary modifications efficiently.

7. Storage of Long Text:
   - Determine the optimal method for storing extensive text data, considering database storage options and performance requirements.
   - Implement a robust storage solution to ensure efficient retrieval and management of sermon transcripts.

## Deliverables:
1. Functional Sermon Transcription and Editing Platform accessible via a user-friendly web interface.
2. Seamless integration with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for accurate transcription.
3. Automated clipping feature for extracting sermon clips from full-service videos.
4. Integration with Language Models for improved transcription quality, speaker identification, and translation.
5. Integration with Pre-existing Translation Services/APIs for Long Text Translation.
6. User-friendly editing interface to modify transcripts, translate sermons, and make necessary adjustments efficiently.
7. Efficient storage solution for storing and retrieving long text data.
