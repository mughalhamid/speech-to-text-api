# Proposal for Speech-to-Text API Selection**

## Objective:
The objective of this proposal is to evaluate and recommend a Speech-to-Text (STT) API that meets the following criteria: low cost, the ability to differentiate between multiple speakers, and high accuracy. We will compare Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, Microsoft Azure Speech Service, and IBM Watson Speech to Text based on these requirements.

## Criteria for Evaluation:

1. Cost-effectiveness:
   - Comparison of pricing models and costs for different usage tiers.
  
2. Speaker Differentiation:
   - Evaluation of the API's capability to differentiate between multiple speakers accurately.
  
3. Accuracy:
   - Assessment of the overall accuracy of transcription provided by each API.

## Comparison:

1. Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API:
   - Cost-effectiveness: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text offers competitive pricing, including a free tier for up to 60 minutes of audio per month and pay-as-you-go pricing thereafter. It provides cost-effective options for small to large-scale usage.
   - Speaker Differentiation: The API supports speaker diarization, allowing it to differentiate between multiple speakers accurately.
   - Accuracy: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text is known for its high accuracy in transcription, especially for clear audio recordings.

2. Microsoft Azure Speech Service:
   - Cost-effectiveness: Microsoft Azure Speech Service provides a free tier with limited usage and pay-as-you-go pricing beyond that. While it offers competitive pricing, it may be slightly more expensive compared to Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for extensive usage.
   - Speaker Differentiation: Azure Speech Service includes speaker recognition capabilities, enabling accurate differentiation between speakers.
   - Accuracy: Azure Speech Service offers high accuracy in transcription, although it may vary depending on the quality of the audio input.

3. IBM Watson Speech to Text:
   - Cost-effectiveness: IBM Watson Speech to Text may have higher initial costs compared to other options, but it offers a free tier with limited usage. Beyond the free tier, pricing can be competitive based on usage volume.
   - Speaker Differentiation: IBM Watson Speech to Text supports speaker diarization, allowing it to distinguish between multiple speakers accurately.
   - Accuracy: IBM Watson Speech to Text is known for its high accuracy in transcription, especially in specialized domains and industries.

## Recommendation:
Based on the evaluation of the above criteria, I recommend the **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API** for its cost-effectiveness, accurate speaker differentiation, and high transcription accuracy. It provides a balance between affordability and performance, making it suitable for your project's requirements.
